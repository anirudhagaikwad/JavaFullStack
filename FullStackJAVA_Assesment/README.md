### Technical and Analytical Thinking and Coding. Project (30 marks: 10 for Technical and Analytical Thinking, 10 for Coding, 10 for Question Answering)

---

### 1. Self Introduction (Set the Context)
- Name: "My name is [your name]."
- Academic Record: "I am a B.Tech CSE student at [college/university name], with a CGPA of [e.g., 8.5/10]."
- Projects Created: "I’ve developed [e.g., a responsive e-commerce page using HTML/CSS], strengthening my frontend skills."
- Activities: "I’ve participated in [e.g., coding challenges or web development seminars], where I [e.g., solved UI challenges]."

---

### 2. Project Description (Cover All 3 Areas)
- Project Overview: "My project, [project name, e.g., ‘StudySync’], is a single-page web app for [purpose, e.g., organizing student study resources]. It’s modern, responsive, and hosted on [e.g., GitHub Pages]."
- Motivation: "I chose this project to [e.g., master Bootstrap 5.3 and explore cloud hosting while building a useful application]."

#### A. Technical and Analytical Thinking (10 Marks)
- Approach: "I designed the UI by [e.g., analyzing user needs for quick access to study resources], using Bootstrap 5.3 for responsive layout."
- Problem-Solving: "To enhance usability, I [e.g., added a collapsible sidebar]. I analyzed [e.g., how single-page apps reduce load times] and applied it."
- Demo Example: "Here’s how I used [e.g., Bootstrap’s grid and JS toggles] to improve layout efficiency."

#### B. Coding (10 Marks)
- Tech Stack: "I used HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and Bootstrap 5.3 for responsiveness. Key features include [e.g., a resource list, search functionality]."
- Code Quality: "My code is well-organized—CSS in separate files, JavaScript with reusable functions. I used Bootstrap components like [e.g., ‘navbar-expand’] to enhance layout."
- Demo Example: "Check out this JS function for [e.g., filtering resources] and the Bootstrap card component for layout."

#### C. Question Answering Preparation (10 Marks)
- Anticipating Questions: "I’ve prepared for questions like [e.g., ‘Why choose Bootstrap over plain CSS?’ or ‘How does hosting work?’]."
- Clarity: "I’ll explain concepts simply, such as [‘Bootstrap simplifies styling with prebuilt components’] or [‘GitHub Pages hosts static sites via Git’]."
- Depth: "I can dive deeper, like [e.g., ‘The JS filter uses array methods for better performance’] or [‘I used a CDN for Bootstrap to speed up load times’]."
- Demo Invitation: "Feel free to ask questions, like [‘How does this feature work?’], and I’ll provide detailed examples."

### Presentation Flow (Step-by-Step)

1. Intro (1 min): Greet, introduce yourself, and mention past projects/activities.
2. Project Overview (1 min): Briefly describe the project, its purpose, and your motivation.
3. Technical & Analytical Thinking (2 min): Discuss your design process, technology choices, and problem-solving approach.
4. Coding (2 min): Highlight features, demonstrate a code snippet (e.g., JS or Bootstrap usage), and explain structure.
5. Demo (2 min): Show the live site ([URL]), resize the browser for responsiveness, and invite questions.
6. Conclusion (1 min): Summarize the project, skills demonstrated, and share the project URL. Invite questions.
7. Q&A (2-3 min): Respond confidently to questions with clarity and examples.

---

### Scoring Focus for Students

- Technical/Analytical Thinking (10/10): Justify your choices (e.g., "Bootstrap’s grid ensures responsiveness") and explain your design logic (e.g., "A single-page app reduces reloads").
- Coding (10/10): Deliver clean, functional code using HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap 5.3. Showcase at least one interactive feature.
- Question Answering (10/10): Be prepared for technical and practical questions, and answer concisely yet thoroughly.

---

### Tips for Success

- Demo: Share the live URL, demonstrate responsiveness, and pause for questions (e.g., "Want to know how the search works?").
- Q&A Preparation: Practice responses for:
  - Tech-related: "Why use Bootstrap 5.3?" (e.g., "It’s mobile-first and feature-rich.")
  - Code-related: "How does this feature work?" (e.g., "This JS function updates the UI dynamically.")
  - Hosting-related: "How did you deploy?" (e.g., "I used Netlify’s drag-and-drop feature.")
- Time Management: Keep it within 7-8 minutes, allowing 2-3 minutes for Q&A.
- Backup: Always have a local copy or screenshot if internet access fails.

### A. Technical and Analytical Thinking (10 Marks)

This section tests your understanding of concepts and logical application.

#### Sample Question Types:
1. Explain the need for ORM and how Hibernate solves it.
2. Describe Hibernate’s architecture.
3. Compare Hibernate with JDBC.
4. Explain Hibernate's lazy loading and caching.
5. In a given scenario, decide when to use HQL vs Criteria API.

---

### B. Coding (10 Marks)

Tests practical ability to implement Hibernate features.

#### Sample Tasks:
1. Create an entity `Student` with fields: id, name, email, and course, using annotations for mapping.
2. Write a Hibernate code snippet to perform CRUD operations, including opening a session, saving an object, and committing a transaction.

---

### C. Question Answering Preparation (10 Marks)

Assesses confidence and clarity in answering questions.

#### Sample Questions:
1. What is ORM and how does Hibernate implement it?
2. What are the different types of Hibernate inheritance strategies?
3. What is the role of `hibernate.cfg.xml` or `hibernate.properties`?
4. What is lazy loading in Hibernate? Provide an example.
5. What are HQL and Criteria API? How do they differ from native SQL?
