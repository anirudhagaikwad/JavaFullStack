CSS provides various units for specifying lengths, which can be categorized into absolute and relative units. 
---

## üìè Absolute Units
These units have a fixed size and do not depend on other elements.

| Unit  | Meaning | Description |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `px` | Pixels | 1 pixel on the screen. Commonly used for precise control. |
| `cm` | Centimeters | Physical length, not commonly used in web design. |
| `mm` | Millimeters | Similar to `cm`, mainly for print styling. |
| `in` | Inches | 1 inch = 2.54 cm = 96 px (default). |
| `pt` | Points | 1 point = 1/72 of an inch (used in print). |
| `pc` | Picas | 1 pica = 12 points. |

## üîÑ Relative Units
These units depend on the parent element, viewport size, or other factors.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Font-Based Units
| Unit  | Meaning | Description |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `em` | Relative to parent font size | `1em` = the font size of the parent element. Useful for scalable layouts. |
| `rem` | Relative to root (`html`) font size | `1rem` = font size of the `html` element (default 16px). More predictable than `em`. |
| `%` | Relative to parent element | `width: 50%` makes the element take 50% of the parent's width. |

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Viewport-Based Units (Responsive Design)
| Unit  | Meaning | Description |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `vw` | Viewport Width | `1vw` = 1% of the viewport's width. |
| `vh` | Viewport Height | `1vh` = 1% of the viewport's height. |
| `vmin` | Smaller of `vw` or `vh` | Useful for maintaining proportions. |
| `vmax` | Larger of `vw` or `vh` | Expands based on the larger viewport dimension. |

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Grid & Flexbox Units
| Unit  | Meaning | Description |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `fr` | Fractional Unit | Used in CSS Grid to divide space proportionally. E.g., `1fr 2fr` gives one-third and two-thirds. |

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Miscellaneous Units
| Unit  | Meaning | Description |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `ex` | Height of "x" character | Rarely used, varies between fonts. |
| `ch` | Width of "0" character | Useful for text-based sizing. |
