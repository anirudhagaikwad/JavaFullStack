the presentation should focus on how well students can respond to questions about their project, alongside the other two criteria:
Technical and Analytical Thinking and Coding. Project (30 marks: 10 for Technical and Analytical Thinking, 10 for Coding, 10 for Question Answering).

### 1. Self Introduction (Set the Context)
- Name: "My name is [your name]."
- Academic Record: "I’m a B.Tech CSE student at [college/university name] with a CGPA of [e.g., 8.5/10]."
- Projects Created: "I’ve built [e.g., a responsive e-commerce page with HTML/CSS], enhancing my frontend expertise."
- Activities: "I’ve participated in [e.g., coding challenges or web dev seminars], where I [e.g., solved UI problems]."


---

### 2. Project Description (Cover All 3 Areas)
- What is the Project?: "My project is [project name, e.g., ‘StudySync’], a single-page web app for [purpose, e.g., organizing student study resources]. It’s modern, responsive, and hosted on [e.g., GitHub Pages]."
- Why I Chose It: "I picked this to [e.g., master Bootstrap 5.3 and cloud hosting while building something useful]."

#### A. Technical and Analytical Thinking (10 Marks)
- Approach: "I designed the UI by [e.g., analyzing user needs for quick resource access]. I used Bootstrap 5.3 for its responsive utilities."
- Problem-Solving: "To improve usability, I [e.g., added a collapsible sidebar]. I analyzed [e.g., how single-page apps save load time] and applied it."
- Demo Point: "Here’s how I used [e.g., Bootstrap’s grid and JS toggles] to optimize the layout."


#### B. Coding (10 Marks)
- Tech Stack: "I coded it with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and Bootstrap 5.3 for responsiveness. Features include [e.g., a resource list, search bar]."
- Code Quality: "My code is [e.g., organized—CSS in separate files, JS with reusable functions]. I used Bootstrap classes like [e.g., ‘navbar-expand’]."
- Demo Point: "Check this JS function for [e.g., filtering resources] and Bootstrap’s card component for layout."


#### C. Question Answering Preparation (10 Marks)
- Anticipate Questions: "I prepared for questions like [e.g., ‘Why Bootstrap over plain CSS?’ or ‘How does hosting work?’]."
- Clarity: "I’ll explain concepts simply, e.g., [‘Bootstrap saves time with prebuilt styles’] or [‘GitHub Pages hosts static files via Git’]."
- Depth: "I can dive into details, like [e.g., ‘The JS filter uses array methods for efficiency’] or [‘I chose a CDN for Bootstrap to reduce load’]."
- Demo Point: "I’ll invite questions during the demo, like [‘How does this feature work?’], and answer with examples."

### Presentation Flow (Step-by-Step)
1. Intro (1 min): Greet, introduce yourself, and mention past projects/activities.
2. Project Overview (1 min): Name the project, its purpose, and your motivation.
3. Technical & Analytical Thinking (2 min): Share your design process, tech choices, and problem-solving (e.g., "I used Bootstrap for scalability").
4. Coding (2 min): Highlight features, show a code snippet (e.g., JS or Bootstrap usage), and explain its structure.
5. Demo (2 min): Show the live site ([URL]), resize the browser for responsiveness, and invite questions (e.g., "Any questions on how this works?").
6. Conclusion (1 min): "This project reflects my skills in [design, coding, explanation]. It’s live at [URL]. I’m ready for your questions!"
7. Q&A (2-3 min): Answer confidently, clearly, and with examples.

### Scoring Focus for Students
- Technical/Analytical (10/10): Justify choices (e.g., "Bootstrap’s grid ensures responsiveness") and explain logic (e.g., "Single-page reduces reloads").
- Coding (10/10): Deliver clean, functional code using HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap 5.3. Show at least one interactive feature (e.g., filter, toggle).
- Question Answering (10/10): Prepare for technical questions (e.g., "Why this layout?") and practical ones (e.g., "How did you deploy?"). Be concise yet thorough.

---

### Tips for Success
- Demo: Share the live URL, demonstrate responsiveness, and pause for questions (e.g., "Want to know how the search works?").
- Q&A Prep: Practice answers for:
  - Tech: "Why Bootstrap 5.3?" (e.g., "It’s modern, mobile-first.")
  - Code: "How does X work?" (e.g., "This JS loop updates the UI.")
  - Hosting: "How’s it on the cloud?" (e.g., "I used Netlify’s drag-and-drop.")
- Time: Keep it 7-8 minutes, leaving 2-3 minutes for Q&A.
- Backup: Have a local copy or screenshot if the internet fails.
